# Flappy Bird Game

## Description

Flappy Bird is a popular side-scrolling game where players control a bird, navigating it through a series of obstacles by tapping to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. The objective is to travel as far as possible without colliding with the obstacles or hitting the ground. I have done it with a helicopter.

## Gameplay

The game features a helicopter that continuously moves forward, and the player's input controls the helicopter's vertical movement. By clicking the mouse button it goes up momentarily. The helicopter descends automatically due to gravity, and the player must time their taps to navigate through openings between the obstacles. Colliding with any obstacle or hitting the ground ends the game, and the player can choose to restart and try to achieve a higher score. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by traveling the furthest distance without crashing.

## Features

- One-Tap Control: The game utilizes a simple control scheme where the player only needs to click the mouse button to play. This makes it accessible and easy to learn for players of all ages.
- Scrolling Background: The game features a dynamic background that scrolls continuously, creating a sense of movement and enhancing the gameplay experience.
- Randomized Obstacles: The game generates obstacles at random heights and sides, adding variability and challenge to each playthrough.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, representing the distance traveled, and displays it during gameplay and on the game over screen. This allows players to compete against themselves and strive for new high scores.
- Game Over Screen: When the player loses, the game presents a game over screen showing the final score and providing an option to restart the game.

## Limitations

- Single Player Only: The game is designed for single-player gameplay and does not include multiplayer or competitive features. However, players can compete against themselves and try to beat their own high scores.
- Lack of Additional Modes: The game focuses on the classic Flappy Bird gameplay and does not include additional modes or variations. The objective is to achieve the highest score by traveling the furthest distance.
- No Tutorial or Instructions: The game assumes players are familiar with the Flappy Bird mechanics and does not provide an in-depth tutorial or instructions within the game. However, the controls are intuitive and easy to understand.
